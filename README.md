# ENIAC × Magist Partnership — A Data Science Story  

This repository contains the first **collaborative project** from our **Data Science & AI course at WBS Coding School**.  
Our goal: explore whether **ENIAC**, a premium tech accessories marketplace, should expand into Brazil and partner with **Magist**, a local SaaS platform.

## 📖 Summary  

This project was more than SQL queries and Tableau dashboards — it was about telling a **business story with data**.  

We started with **raw data from Magist** and ran exploratory SQL queries (`magist_big_picture.sql`) to see the big picture: orders, products, sellers, and delivery performance.  

Next, we tackled specific **business questions** (`business_questions.sql`) that would help Eniac decide:  
- Are tech products strong in Magist’s catalog?  
- Who are the key sellers driving growth?  
- How reliable is delivery performance?  

To complement our analysis, we did **external market research** (via Perplexity) on Brazil’s e-commerce market in 2017–2018 — a time when the industry was booming.  

Finally, we brought everything together in **Tableau Public** and **Google Slides**, and presented our findings to a role-play CEO.  

**Our conclusion:**  
Brazil is definitely the right market for Eniac, and Magist could be a useful partner — **but only under certain conditions.**

## 🎓 Key Learnings  

- How to move from **raw data → insights → recommendations**.  
- The importance of **storytelling with data** — decisions aren’t made from numbers alone.  
- **Teamwork in data science**: dividing roles (products, sellers, delivery) and merging findings.  
- Practicing **neutral analysis**: keeping personal bias separate from the data.  
- Presenting to a **business audience** is very different from activist or community speeches — passion is good, but logic and clarity must lead.

## ⚡ Challenges Overcame  

- **Price mismatch:** Magist’s tech products averaged ~€133, far below Eniac’s €540 premium range. We reframed this as both a challenge and an opportunity.  
- **Delivery concerns:** Average delivery was 12.5 days, but 92% were on time. This showed Magist met local standards, though premium buyers expect faster.  
- **First collaboration:** As a team of 4, we had to learn how to split the work, sync insights, and build one consistent story.

## 💡 Additional Reflections  

For me, the most valuable part was presenting to the “CEO.”  

Coming from a background in **human rights and community advocacy in the Philippines**, I am used to fiery speeches. But this was different: a **business setting** demands facts, plots, and logical conclusions.  

It taught me that:  
- Passion can carry an audience, but in business it must be anchored by data.  
- Objectivity and clarity are skills I want to refine further in future projects.
